            <p>Otoplasty is the medical term for the outer ear surgery or reshaping which generally involves general anesthesia, cutting, long recovery, pain, Keloid, possible complications, etc. However, for the first in Florida history, the Allure Institute for Plastic Surgery medical team can provide a non-surgical alternative to permanently fix prominent ears.</p>
            <p>The minimally invasive otoplasty serves the identical purpose to reduce ear prominence or protruding ears, correcting asymmetry, and enhancing the facial anatomy by delivering symmetry and aesthetic proportions. Prominent or protruding ears are a source of emotional distress, especially for children. Many suffer bullying and are compared with Dumbo Ears (A Disney cartoon character). Unfortunately, many don’t have the knowledge of the options available and try to hide by growing their hair, using hats, or any other form.</p>
            <p>Ear Pinning Without Surgery is extremely affordable compared to traditional Otoplasty. In addition, no ear cartilage cutting is necessary to produce permanent results. Thus, adults and children can come back to their daily routines and eliminate the possibility of any Permanent Scars.<br>

              In summary, Incisionless Otoplasty is a great procedure for pinning protruding ears in 1-hour single office visit avoiding physiological distress and enhancing cosmetic appearance.</p>
