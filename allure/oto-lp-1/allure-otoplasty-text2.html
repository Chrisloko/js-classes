              <h2>How is the Incisionless Otoplasty Performed?</h2>
              <p>The procedure is performed at our outpatient AAAAFC certified surgery center in Jupiter, Florida. It usually takes 1 hour to perform the procedure for both ears. After thoroughly sterile skin preparation, local anesthesia is delivered at strategic points. Permanent sutures are passed through the cartilage and are invisible. Thus, expediting the healing and decreasing the chances of a negative event. The body naturally metabolizes the sutures, but the reshaped ears cartilage will remain permanently. The procedure takes approximately 1 hour, and patients can be picked up or drive home.</p>
