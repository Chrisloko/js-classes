                      <p>Both dermal fillers and Botox are popular non-surgical treatments that are used to correct or improve the signs of aging. Both products work very differently and serve a different purpose.</p>
                      <p>Dermal fillers are injectable products that are used to restore volume loss but also to erase or smooth out fine lines and wrinkles.</p>
                      <p>Botox on the other hand is a treatment that prevents the formation of fine lines and wrinkles by relaxing the strong contraction of expression lines. Botox is typically used to smooth out dynamic wrinkles that are caused by muscle movements, such as frown lines, forehead wrinkles, and crow's feet.</p>

                      <ol>
                      <li>
                      <p>It is important to avoid activities that increase blood flow to the treated area, such as exercise and heavy lifting, for at least 24-48 hours after treatment. This will help reduce swelling and minimize the risk of bruising.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      <p>Exposure to heat, such as hot showers and saunas, can cause swelling and irritation to the treated area. It is also important to protect your skin from the sun by wearing a hat and sunscreen with a high SPF.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      <p>It is important to avoid touching or massaging the treated area for at least 24 hours after treatment. This can help prevent the filler from moving or spreading to unintended areas.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      <p>It is recommended to avoid alcohol and blood thinners, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, for at least 24 hours after treatment. These substances can increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.</p>

                      <li>Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance that is found in the skin, joints, and eyes. It is a popular ingredient in dermal fillers because it has the ability to hold onto water, which helps to plump up the skin and smooth out wrinkles.</li>

Calcium hydroxylapatite fillers, such as Radiesse, generally last longer, up to two years. Poly-L-lactic acid fillers, such as Sculptra, also tend to last longer, up to two years or more.</p>
                              <p>It's important to note that dermal fillers duration can vary from person to person, contributing factors are: patient metabolism, treated area, type of filler, and the amount of product used. Therefore results can never be guaranteed.</p>
                              <p>We recommend each patient to discuss their treatment goals with a qualified practitioner and to carefully consider the pros and cons of different dermal filler products before making a decision.</p>

                            <p>Dermal fillers are injectable products that are used to restore volume loss but also to erase or smooth out fine lines and wrinkles.</p>
                            <p>Botox on the other hand is a treatment that prevents the formation of fine lines and wrinkles by relaxing the strong contraction of expression lines. Botox is typically used to smooth out dynamic wrinkles that are caused by muscle movements, such as frown lines, forehead wrinkles, and crow's feet.</p>

                            <p>It is important to avoid activities that increase blood flow to the treated area, such as exercise and heavy lifting, for at least 24-48 hours after treatment. This will help reduce swelling and minimize the risk of bruising.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <p>Exposure to heat, such as hot showers and saunas, can cause swelling and irritation to the treated area. It is also important to protect your skin from the sun by wearing a hat and sunscreen with a high SPF.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <p>It is important to avoid touching or massaging the treated area for at least 24 hours after treatment. This can help prevent the filler from moving or spreading to unintended areas.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <p>It is recommended to avoid alcohol and blood thinners, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, for at least 24 hours after treatment. These substances can increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.</p>
